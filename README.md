            Located on the banks of the Ariyankuppam River, Arikamedu is a famous Indo-Roman archaeological site. It is among the well-known tourist places near Pondicherry. Inhabited by Romans, French, and Cholas centuries ago, the town was once a popular trade center of the region.

Excavation of the site was started in 1940 and since then interesting details have been unearthed. The site has been acquired by the Archaeological Survey of India for its cultural importance as the only surviving place with remnants of Roman existence in India during 300 BC - 1800 AD.

Valuable artifacts and relics excavated from the site are preserved in the Pondicherry Museum. They give visitors an insight into the history and culture of Arikamedu. The staggering ruins lure history buffs and photographers. A walk along the trails takes you back to the opulent era of trade and exchange in the 1st century BC.
